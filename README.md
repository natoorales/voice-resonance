oice Resonance Plugin - Development Session Recap (August 13, 2025)
This session focused on resolving critical initialization errors and successfully establishing the foundational backend components for the Voice Resonance plugin.

Issues Resolved
Frontend JavaScript Syntax Error:
Problem: A persistent Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token in app.min.js was traced to the openDedicatedCalibrationWindow method in main.js, caused by improper use of nested template literals and unescaped characters within a large string literal.
Solution: Refactored the method in assets/js/src/main.js to use standard string concatenation and proper escaping. Rebuilt assets/js/dist/app.min.js locally and uploaded it. The frontend now loads and initializes correctly.
Backend VR_Database_Manager Instantiation & Database Errors:
Problem: The VR_Database_Manager class was not being instantiated by the VR_API_Controller, leading to persistent VR_API_Controller: VR_Database_Manager not instantiated. errors in debug.log. This was caused by a combination of issues:
Missing <?php tag at the beginning of includes/database/class-database-manager.php.
Incorrect file structure (missing class declaration).
Mismatch between the autoloader's expected filename/path and the actual file.
SQL syntax errors in the create_tables method due to inline comments (-- ...) that dbDelta couldn't parse correctly during ALTER TABLE operations.
Solutions Implemented:
File Creation & Structure: Created/Corrected includes/database/class-database-manager.php with the proper <?php tag and class VR_Database_Manager { ... } structure.
Autoloader: Updated includes/class-autoloader.php to include an override map, explicitly pointing VR_Database_Manager to includes/database/class-database-manager.php.
SQL Syntax: Corrected the create_tables method in VR_Database_Manager by removing the problematic inline SQL comments.
Plugin Re-activation: Re-activated the plugin to ensure all changes took effect.
Current Status (As of Session End)
✅ Frontend: Loads correctly, initializes audio, calls /check-pro, and opens the calibration window without JavaScript errors.
✅ Backend API: Routes are registered. Core endpoints (/test, /check-pro, /process-calibration) are defined and accessible. The critical fix for Pro status check is in place.
✅ Dependency Management: PHP dependencies (Stripe SDK) are installed. The autoloader chain works. NPM builds remain a local requirement.
✅ Core Plugin Structure: Plugin file, autoloader, activation/deactivation hooks, and main initialization (VR_Plugin) are functional.
✅ Database Manager: RESOLVED. VR_Database_Manager is now correctly instantiated. The create_tables method executes cleanly during plugin activation. The necessary database tables (wp_vr_user_profiles, wp_vr_analysis_sessions, wp_vr_analysis_segments) are ready to be used.
✅ Shortcode & Assets: [voice_resonance_app] shortcode renders the app container. CSS and JS assets are enqueued correctly.
Plan Forward (For Tomorrow's Session)
With the core infrastructure stable, the focus shifts to implementing the core application logic.

Implement Audio Processing Logic (Calibration):
Task: Enhance the VR_API_Controller::process_calibration method.
Goal: Receive uploaded "true" and "false" audio samples, perform (placeholder or initial real) audio analysis to extract features, calculate a user profile based on the comparison, and save this profile to the database using VR_Database_Manager::save_user_profile.
Test Full Calibration Workflow:
Task: Perform the calibration process via the frontend.
Goal: Verify that the /process-calibration endpoint successfully saves data to the wp_vr_user_profiles table.
Begin Main Analysis Logic:
Task: Start developing the core logic to analyze new audio segments.
Goal: Create the foundation for comparing features of new audio against the stored user calibration profile.
Connect Frontend Analysis to Backend:
* Task: Implement a new API endpoint (e.g., POST /analyze-segment) in VR_API_Controller and update the frontend JavaScript to send live audio segments to this endpoint.
* Goal: Enable real-time VRI score calculation by comparing live speech features to the benchmark profile.

Continue Sequential Development:
Proceed with subsequent steps: Admin interface, Stripe integration, and frontend refinements, as outlined in the original readme.md.txt recap.
